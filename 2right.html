<h1>This is right, just not the right way </h1>

<p>
<p Walking with your eyes closed might not be the best idea... </p>

<a href="index.html"> "AAAHHH!" </a>
, you scream.
Your old stuffed animal grew to the size of Godzilla and started destroying the city. You watch in despair as your once beloved Fuzzy Wuzzy turns everything to dust.</p>

<p> 
<p style="font-size:160%;"> All because you forgot to walk your fish before you left the house. (smh).</p>
