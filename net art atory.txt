Your old stuffed animal grew to the size of Godzilla and started destroying the city. You watch in despair as your once beloved Fuzzy Wuzzy turns everything to dust.</p>

<p> 
<p style="font-size:160%;"> All because you forgot to walk your fish before you left the house. (smh). Your scream will take you back to try one more time. </p>

<h1>A wonderful choice indeed.</h1>
<p>
Lobster rolls are actually one of your favorite dishes, this is a fine choice. You buy your lobster roll (with your eyes still closed) and smile with joy. It smells so good and your mouth waters thinking about how good it's going to be, but you have to wait until you get home to eat it.

-------------------STEAK-------------------

- fun fact: you actually don't like steak but since you chose to follow the steak scent you're committed (and that's how I wrote the story). 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>What's the big idea?</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>So that's how you feel...</h1>
<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> You must think this is a game...YOU HATE STEAK AS WELL! Has walking in the dark made you forget the things steak has done to you? Similar to hotdogs, they give you the bubbly, but they don't make you explode, oh no no no that'd be too easy. 
<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> Before you even get to purchase the steak the person working at the stand puts you in a genjutsu; forever crying as you eat steak.

<h1>So close, yet so far</h1>
<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> As much as you love crepes and have no allergies to them, you made a pact with your sibling to get a crepe for them every time you got one. Unfortunately, you don't have enough money for two crepes. So sad.</p>

<p style="font-size:160%;"> <a href="3straight.html"> Try again. </a>

<title>The End</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>The reality of it all</h1>
<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> You turn back around to trace your steps, but something stops you; you've bumped into someone. Not only have you bumped into someone, but your precious lobster roll has taken a trip...to the ground. Your eyes are open at this point, and in shock you stare at your lobster roll as tears start to well up in your eyes.
