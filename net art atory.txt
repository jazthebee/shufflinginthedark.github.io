It's dark.

Im walking blindly. I stop.
--> go left
--> go right
--> continue straight


-------------------LEFT--------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>

<title>Not left x_x</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Oh no! :(</h1>

<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> Walking with your eyes closed might not be the best idea... </p>

<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> You slowly turn left and take one step. As your luck would have it, you fall into a pit of rubber snakes and explode. (Your allergies to rubber finally got the best of you).</p>

<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> Click the slithering serpents and try again (click the snakes).</p>

<h1>This is right, just not the right way </h1>

<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> Walking with your eyes closed might not be the best idea... 
</p>

<p style="font-size:160%;"> You turn to your right and shuffle forward a couple of steps. </p>
 

<p style="font-size:160%;"> <a href="index.html"> "AAAHHH!", </a> you scream.
Your old stuffed animal grew to the size of Godzilla and started destroying the city. You watch in despair as your once beloved Fuzzy Wuzzy turns everything to dust.</p>

<p> 
<p style="font-size:160%;"> All because you forgot to walk your fish before you left the house. (smh). Your scream will take you back to try one more time. </p>
