<h1>A wonderful choice indeed.</h1>
<p>
Lobster rolls are actually one of your favorite dishes, this is a fine choice. You buy your lobster roll (with your eyes still closed) and smile with joy. It smells so good and your mouth waters thinking about how good it's going to be, but you have to wait until you get home to eat it.

- fun fact: you actually don't like steak but since you chose to follow the steak scent you're committed (and that's how I wrote the story).
