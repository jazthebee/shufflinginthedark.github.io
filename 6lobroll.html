<p style="font-size:160%;"> Lobster rolls are actually one of your favorite dishes, this is a fine choice. You buy your lobster roll (with your eyes still closed) and smile with joy. It smells so good and your mouth waters thinking about how good it's going to be, but you have to wait until you get <a style="font-size:160%;"> <a href="9theend.html"> "home" </a> 
to eat it.
