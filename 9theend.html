<h1>The reality of it all</h1>
<p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"> You turn back around to trace your steps, but something stops you; you've bumped into someone. Not only have you bumped into someone, but your precious lobster roll has taken a trip...a trip to the ground. Your eyes are open at this point, and in shock you stare at your lobster roll as tears start to well up in your eyes.
