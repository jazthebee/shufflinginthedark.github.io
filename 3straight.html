<h1>Ah, I see you've made it to round two, welcome. </h1>

<p>You shyly take five steps forward and avoid some of your worst fates. You hear the sound of voices grow,  and a number of aromas flow through your nose. Not many people know, but your sense of smell is incredible. Burgers, hot dogs, lobster rolls, steak, and crepes are near. Everything's so good but you're a brokie and can only afford one.</p>

<p>Which scent will you follow?</p>
